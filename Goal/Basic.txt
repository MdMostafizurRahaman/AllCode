1.a string gets an input from a string first space separeted portion. Where as getline(cin, str); take the whole line of input where the 	line is space separated upto next line. Means it takes input a whole line not a paragraph.





--------------------------Time Complexity---------------------
Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size

Time Complexity measured:::
1.Computed in worst case scenario
2.Avoid constant
3.Avoid lower values
